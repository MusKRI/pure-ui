This guide will show you how to use detached triggers with base ui components like dialog, popover, menu, etc.

## Detached Triggers?

**Detached triggers** allow you to physically separate a component's trigger (like a button that opens a dialog) from the component's root element in your JSX structure. They remain functionally connected through a special "**handle**" mechanism.

## Traditional Approach

Normally, you would nest the trigger inside the component's root element.

```tsx highlight={2}
<Dialog>
  <DialogTrigger>Open Dialog</DialogTrigger> {/* Trigger INSIDE Root */}
  <DialogPopup>...</DialogPopup>
</Dialog>
```

Here, the `<DialogTrigger>` must be a child of the `<Dialog>`. This works fine but becomes limiting when:

- Your trigger needs to be in different part of the UI hierarchy.
- You want sevaral buttons in different places to open the same dialog.

## Detached Approach

With detached triggers:

```tsx highlight={4,8,15}
import { Dialog as DialogPrimitive } from "@base-ui-components/react/dialog";

// 1. Create a handle
const myDialog = DialogPrimitive.createHandle();

// 2. Place trigger ANYWHERE in your app
<DialogTrigger
  handle={myDialog}
>
  Open Dialog
</DialogTrigger>

// 3. Place root ANYWHERE ELSE
<Dialog
  handle={myDialog}
>
  <DialogPopup>...</DialogPopup>
</Dialog>
```

Here, the `handle` acts as a "wireless connection" between the trigger and the root. Both reference the same handle, so they communicate even though they are not parent-child in the DOM.

## How It Works

### The Handle

```tsx
const myDialog = DialogPrimitive.createHandle();
```

The `createHandle` function returns a special reference object that:

- Manages the open/close state internally
- Coordinates between triggers and the root component
- Maintains accessibility relationships (ARIA attributes)
- Handles focus management

### Linking Components

Both the `Trigger` and `Root` accept a `handle` prop:

```tsx
<DialogTrigger handle={myDialog} />  // Links to the handle
<Dialog handle={myDialog} />     // Links to the same handle
```

When you click the trigger, it signals through the handle to open the dialog, even if they are not related in the DOM tree.
