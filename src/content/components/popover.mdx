  PopoverTrigger,
  PopoverPopup,

## Usage

### With Arrow

You can pass `showArrow` as true to `PopoverPopup` to show arrow on popover. By default, it is false.

<ComponentShowcase name="popover-with-arrow-demo" />

### Sides

You can pass `side` to `PopoverPopup` to change the side of the popover. By default, it is `bottom`.

<ComponentShowcase name="popover-sides-demo" />

### Open on Hover

By default, Popover opens when the trigger is clicked. You can pass `openOnHover` to Popover to open it when the trigger is hovered.

<ComponentShowcase name="popover-with-hover-demo" />

You can pass `delay` to Popover to change the delay time for opening the popover. By default, it is 100ms.

```tsx
<Popover openOnHover delay={200}>
  ...
</Popover>
```

You can also pass `closeDelay` of Popover to change the delay time for closing the popover. By default, it is 0ms.

```tsx
<Popover openOnHover closeDelay={200}>
  ...
</Popover>
```

**Note that These two properties will only be used when `openOnHover` is true.**

### Modality of Popover

The `modal` property of `Popover` controls how users can interact with the page when the popover is open.

**`modal={true}`** (default) -
Focus is trapped, scrolling is locked, and outside interactions are disabled.

**`modal={false}`** -
Users can interact with both the popover and the rest of the page freely.

**`modal="trap-focus"`** -
Focus is trapped for keyboard navigation, but scrolling and outside pointer interactions remain enabled.

### Offset

You can pass `sideOffset` to `PopoverPopup` to change the offset of the popover. By default, it is 4.

<ComponentShowcase name="popover-offset-demo" />

**TIP**: If you want to use arrow on popover, make sure to keep sideOffset not less than 8.
