title: Introduction
description: Pure UI is a curated collection of refined, animated, and accessible components built with Base UI, Tailwind CSS, Motion, and other high-quality open source libraries.

Pure UI builds on Base UI's headless primitives, layering thoughtful designs, smooth animations, and enhanced functionality. Each component is crafted for flexibility and ease of use, with composable building blocks for rapid UI development.

Pure UI is designed, built and maintained by [Krishna](https://x.com/_MusKRii) for [Kamui](https://www.kam-ui.com/).
