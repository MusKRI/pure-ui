This guide provides the essentials for adding **Pure UI** components to your React application.

## Prerequisites

Pure UI components are built with [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com). Before you begin, make sure you have a React project set up with Tailwind CSS.

## Adding Components

You can add components **automatically with the shadcn CLI** or **manually by copying the files**.

## Styling

Components are styled with the design token system, which is defined by CSS variables and implemented with Tailwind CSS.

The variables are the same as shadcn/ui, and are fully customizable. You can modify them in your global stylesheet (e.g., `app/globals.css`) to match your design system.

## Migration from Radix UI

For developers migrating from **Radix UI**, many of our **UI primitives** include instructions and examples for translating equivalent Radix components to Base UI. This ensures a smooth transition while preserving accessibility, behaviors, and API patterns.
