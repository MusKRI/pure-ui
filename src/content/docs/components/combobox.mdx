## Key Points

- **Value Matching**: The `value` prop in `ComboboxItem` must match the type of items in you array. For objects, you can pass the entire object as the value.
- **Render Function**: The `<ComboboxList>` children is a render function that receives each item and lets you customize how it's displayed.

## Examples

### Basic

You can use array of simple data primitive values as items. Notice in example below that we are using array of strings as items passed to Combobox component.

<ComponentShowcase name="combobox-basic-demo" />

### With Objects as Items

You can use array of objects as items. As mentioned in **key points**, the `value` prop in `ComboboxItem` must match the type of items in your array. For objects, you can pass the entire object as the value.

<ComponentShowcase name="combobox-with-objects-items-demo" />

Notice in above example that we are using `label` property in each item object of items. By default, the `label` property is used to display selected item in the input.

In example below we are not using `label` property in each item object of items. In this case, whole object is displayed in the input which we don't want to show in the input :(

<ComponentShowcase name="combobox-objects-without-label-demo" />

To use custom label or other properties of the object to show in the input, you can use `itemToStringLabel` function as prop to `Combobox` component.

<ComponentShowcase name="combobox-item-to-string-label-demo" />

### Controlled Combobox

You can use `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the selected item in the combobox.

<ComponentShowcase name="combobox-controlled-demo" />

### With Label

You can use `ComboboxLabel` component to add a label to the combobox.

<ComponentShowcase name="combobox-with-label-demo" />

### Auto Highlighting

You can use `autoHighlight` prop to enable auto highlighting of the items in the combobox. Now try searching for something like "app" and you will see that the first matching item is highlighted.

<ComponentShowcase name="combobox-with-auto-highlighting-demo" />

### Multiple Select

You can allow multiple selection by passing `multiple` prop to the `Combobox` component. And selected items will be displayed in the input as `ComboboxChip` that can be removed.

<ComponentShowcase name="combobox-multiple-selection-demo" />

### Input Inside Popup

**Important:** You need to pass `showTrigger={false}` to the `ComboboxInput` component when you are using it inside the `ComboboxPopup` component. This will prevent us to have only one trigger against which popup will be shown. otherwise, we'll end up having two triggers in Combobox and that will cause issues.

<ComponentShowcase name="combobox-input-inside-popup-demo" />

### Clearable Combobox

You can show clear button by passing `isClearable` prop to the `ComboboxInput` component.

<ComponentShowcase name="combobox-clearable-demo" />
