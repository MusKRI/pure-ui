## Create a new Next.js project

Start by creating a new Next.js project using following command:

<InstallationCommands
  type="package-installation"
  npmCommand="npx create-next-app@latest my-app"
  pnpmCommand="pnpm dlx create-next-app@latest my-app"
  yarnCommand="yarn create-next-app@latest my-app"
  bunCommand="bunx --bun create-next-app@latest my-app"
/>

Replace `my-app` with your project name.

You will be asked a few questions to configure your project. Answer them according to your preferences.

```bash filename="Terminal" noCopy
? Would you like to use the recommended Next.js defaults? » No, customize settings
? Would you like to use TypeScript? » Yes
? Which linter would you like to use? » Biome
? Would you like to use React Compiler? » Yes
? Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? » Yes
? Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? » Yes
? Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) » Yes
? Would you like to customize the default import alias(`@/*` by default)? » No
```

Currently, I would like to use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) as the linter. You can use other linters if you want.

## Shadcn CLI

Run the shadcn init command to setup your project:

<InstallationCommands
  type="package-installation"
  npmCommand="npx shadcn@latest init"
  pnpmCommand="pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init"
  yarnCommand="yarn shadcn@latest init"
  bunCommand="bunx --bun shadcn@latest init"
/>
